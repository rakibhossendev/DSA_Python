# Amstrong number
- An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

### For example:
- 153 is an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
- 370 is an Armstrong number because 3^3 + 7^3 + 0^3 = 27 + 343 + 0 = 370
